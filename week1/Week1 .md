C is compiled language, as opposed to interpreted language

Source code needs to be converted into machine code before it can run

GCC - GNU Compiler Collection



Preprocesssor

Compiler: generate IR code 

Assembler: takes IR code and transfer it into object code - binary code

Linker



Using ampersand is to access the memory location (address) of that variable 

Thus the function will receive the a pointer to the address of the variable 



Source code -> Compiler --> Machine code 

Make file name 



Functions, arguments

argument --> function --> return value 

rmdir 

Code

#### Type

bool char long double

%li - long integer



Const: MINE - capitalize the variable



for loop execution order

start to count from the limit then decrement 

increment 

start from 0

start from 1



for loop and while loop - the scope of the variable



C execute code sequentially, from the top to the buttom 

There is one way to avoid this issue - copy the function return type, function name and parameters

Round



do while 



Floating-point imprecision



int / int -> int 

(float) int 



Integer overflow 

Round

#### Summary

1. conditional clause 
2. loop - for, while, do while 
3. get input, print format 
4. syntactic sugar - counter, counter += counter
5. Assign operator 
6. function and main order
